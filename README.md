# Element template SVG converter

Coming soon! With Camunda 8 you are now able to attach custom icons to items in Element Templates. SVGs (Scalable Vector Graphics) are ideal since they are vector, rather than raster, diagrams meaning they can scale infinitely in size while retaining the original fidelity. This utility will convert SVG diagrams for use as 18px by 18px task icons.
